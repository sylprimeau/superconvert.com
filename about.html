    <p align=center>Why use SuperConvert?</p>
    <p>I created SuperConvert because I wanted an easier way to make multiple conversions than is currently available online. Every online unit converter that I have used requires so many clicks just to make one conversion, forget about doing several! A typical conversion can take as many as TEN seperate actions to complete. First you need to click on the category of conversion you'd like to make. Then you have to choose the source units by first clicking on the drop-down list and then clicking on the unit type. Then you need to click the text box and enter a number. Once that's done, you have to repeat the process for the target units. Click on the drop-down, click on the unit type, click on the text box and enter a number. Only then can you FINALLY click on the OK button to get your answer. That's 10 actions!!! And if you want to do another conversion you have to go through all that AGAIN!</p>
    <p>With SuperConvert, you can get ALL the convesions you need with only ONE action! Once the page is loaded, just enter a number. You don't even need to click the text box first (unless you're on a touch device)!</p>
    <p>ONE action. That's it! Enter your source number and you can immediately see up to 30 different conversions all at once. Want to know how many milliliters there are in 5 cups? It's there. Want to know how many kilometers there are in 234 miles? That's there too. Want to know what 76 degrees Fahrenheit is in Celcius? No problem, that's there too. You can customize your home screen with up to 30 different conversions from any unit to any unit (within the same category)!</p>
    <p>Imagine following a recipe where you need to convert several things in a row. Say you wanted to convert 5 teaspoons to milliliters, 6 ounces to grams, and 8 inches to centimeters, with other converters you would normally have to perfom more than 30 actions to do that. In SuperConvert, however, you could do it in as little as 5 actions. Enter "5", click text box, enter "6", click text box, enter "8". That's it. You're done!</p>
